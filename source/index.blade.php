<h2>Why Vessel?</h2>
<p>Vessel started as a bash script I put together to make working with Docker easier.</p>

<p>It all started because Docker commands are cumbersome to type. You end up in the CLI pretty often when hacking on Laravel projects - a typical workflow in Laravel involves creating controllers or models, creating and running migrations, running queue workers, adding more packages, and more!</p>

<p>I developed this workflow from my own daily use, and even <a href="https://serversforhackers.com/dockerized-app" title="docker workflow">created a free video series about it</a>. However, I wanted to make something more official that everyone could easily use.</p>

<p>This goal of this project is to be as simple as possible while also giving people a glimpse into how Docker works. I hope you find Docker a really neat way to compartmentalize your projects, and make hacking on projects (on any machine) a breeze.</p>

<h2>What's Included</h2>

<p>The aim of this project is simplicity. It (only) includes:</p>
